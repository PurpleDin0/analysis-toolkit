# Writing Style Builder - Student Handout

## What This Is

You are going to build a personal writing style guide using AI. The guide captures your authentic voice so that when you use AI writing tools in the future, the output sounds like you wrote it, not like a chatbot did.

## What You Need

- The **STUDENT_PROMPT.md** file (provided by your instructor)
- **3-5 samples** of your own writing (2,000-5,000 words total)
- **30-45 minutes** for the initial build, plus 15-30 minutes to test and refine
- Access to Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, or another AI chat tool

## Choosing Your Samples

Pick writing that represents your real voice.

**Good samples:** Papers where you felt confident in your writing. Work that sounds like you. Different types of writing if you write for different contexts (academic, professional, creative).

**Bad samples:** Writing you rushed through and don't identify with. Papers you rewrote to match what you thought the professor wanted. Someone else's work.

Do not "clean up" your samples beyond fixing obvious typos. The AI needs to see your actual patterns, not an idealized version.

## Step by Step

**Step 1:** Open a new conversation in Claude.ai (or your preferred AI tool).

**Step 2:** Upload the STUDENT_PROMPT.md file. If your tool doesn't support file uploads, copy and paste the full contents of the file into the chat.

**Step 3:** Upload your 3-5 writing samples in the same message or as follow-up attachments.

**Step 4:** The AI will ask you questions about your writing preferences (audience, tone, structure, evidence habits). Answer honestly. There are no wrong answers. The goal is to capture what you actually do, not what you think you should do.

**Step 5:** The AI will analyze your samples and build a test piece in your style. Read it carefully. Does it sound like you?

**Step 6:** If the test sample doesn't sound right, tell the AI what's off. Be specific: "I wouldn't use that phrase," "My paragraphs are shorter than that," "I don't open with questions." The AI will revise and ask again.

**Step 7:** Once you approve the test sample, the AI delivers your full style guide package.

## What You Get

1. **Style Analysis** - A detailed breakdown of your writing patterns with examples from your work.
2. **Prompt Template** - A self-contained set of instructions you can paste into any future AI conversation to get writing that matches your voice.
3. **User Style Config** - A condensed version you can paste into Claude's profile settings so it applies your style automatically. (On other platforms, use the full Prompt Template instead.)
4. **Test Sample** - A 500-750 word piece demonstrating your style.
5. **Usage Guide** - Instructions for how to use and refine your style guide over time.

## The AI Contamination Problem (Read This)

This is the concept that makes the whole assignment work.

You might assume that if you give an AI your best writing, it will write like you. That is not what happens. Even when the AI correctly identifies your patterns, it injects its own default habits when it generates text. Your clean, authentic voice comes back contaminated with AI tells you never used.

**Example.** Your writing:

> "The study examined three variables. Pressure had the strongest effect."

What the AI generates "in your style" without constraints:

> "It's worth noting that the study examined a pivotal set of variables, highlighting the transformative nature of pressure's impact."

The AI added "it's worth noting," "pivotal," "highlighting," and "transformative." You never wrote any of those. That is contamination.

**The fix:** Your style guide includes explicit bans ("Do not use") on common AI patterns. The prompt file already contains a default ban list. During the build process, the AI checks whether your writing actually uses any banned patterns and asks you before removing them from the list.

This is not about fixing your writing. It is about preventing the AI from ruining your voice.

## Common AI Patterns Your Style Guide Bans

These are default AI habits that get injected into your style unless explicitly blocked:

- **Importance puffing:** "pivotal moment," "significant shift," "notable example"
- **Generic superlatives:** "groundbreaking," "transformative," "cutting-edge"
- **Padding openers:** "It is worth noting that," "It is important to recognize"
- **Trailing participles:** "reflecting the importance of," "highlighting the need for"
- **Marketing language:** "robust," "dynamic," "seamless," "vibrant"
- **Formulaic contrasts:** "It's not just X, it's Y"; "not only X, but also Y"
- **AI filler:** "At its core," "In today's landscape," "delve into," "nuanced"
- **Triple lists:** Defaulting to exactly three examples every time
- **Overused transitions:** "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"

If your writing genuinely uses any of these patterns, the AI will flag them and ask you. They will not be removed without your input.

## Using Your Style Guide After This Assignment

**In new AI conversations:** Paste your Prompt Template at the start of a conversation, then give the AI your writing task.

**In Claude.ai settings:** Go to Settings > Profile > Writing Style. Paste your User Style Config. Claude will apply your style automatically in every conversation.

**On other platforms:** Upload the Prompt Template file or paste it at the start of a conversation.

**When results drift:** Tell the AI what's wrong. "That doesn't sound like me. Check my style guide section on [tone/structure/vocabulary]." Iterate until it matches.

## What to Submit

Your instructor will specify exact requirements, but the standard submission is:

1. Your complete style guide (all five deliverables)
2. A 500-word test sample written using your style guide
3. A short reflection (one paragraph): "What did you learn about your writing?"

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't have enough writing samples."** Use what you have, minimum 2,000 words. You can update the style guide as you produce more writing.

**"My samples show different styles."** That is useful information. Tell the AI. You may need separate style configs for different contexts, or a flexible core style that adapts.

**"The test sample doesn't sound like me."** Expected on the first try. Tell the AI what's wrong. Be specific. Iterate.

**"My style guide is too complicated."** Ask the AI to simplify to 5-7 core rules. You can always add detail later.

**"The AI keeps using banned patterns."** Make your "Do Not Use" list more explicit. Add the specific phrases you keep seeing.

## Why This Matters Beyond This Class

You are building a career tool. The style guide works in any AI chat tool, for any writing context. As AI tools evolve, you will have a grounded understanding of how to use them without losing your voice. Update your style guide as your writing develops.

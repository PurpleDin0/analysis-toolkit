# Writing Style Builder

**How to use:** Upload this file to Claude.ai (or ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) along with 3-5 samples of your writing (2,000-5,000 words total). The AI will walk you through the rest.

You are a writing style analyst. I want you to analyze my writing samples and build a personalized style guide that preserves my authentic voice when I use AI writing tools.

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Ask Me Questions

Before analyzing my samples, ask me these questions in a conversational format. Do not dump them all at once. Group them naturally (2-3 at a time) and wait for my answers before continuing.

**Context:**
- What type of writing matters most to me? (Academic, professional, creative, technical, etc.)
- Who is my primary audience?
- What contexts will I use this style guide in?

**Tone & Structure:**
- How formal is my writing? (Very formal, professional, conversational?)
- Do I lean assertive, diplomatic, neutral, or something else?
- Do I prefer short paragraphs or longer developed ones?
- Am I a headers-and-subheadings writer, or do I prefer flowing prose?

**Evidence & Citations:**
- How do I use evidence? (Heavy citations, occasional references, mostly original analysis?)
- Do I prefer direct quotes or paraphrasing?
- What citation style do I use?

**Personal Patterns:**
- Are there specific phrases, structures, or techniques I always use?
- Are there things I deliberately avoid?
- Do I write differently for different audiences? Should I have multiple style configs?

### Phase 2: Analyze My Samples

After I answer your questions, analyze my uploaded writing samples. Extract:

**Quantitative patterns:**
- Average sentence length and variation
- Paragraph length and structure
- Vocabulary complexity level
- Punctuation habits (comma density, semicolons, parentheses, dashes, colons)

**Qualitative patterns:**
- How I open and close pieces
- How I build and structure arguments
- How I integrate evidence and examples
- Tone markers and voice characteristics
- Rhetorical devices I favor
- Transition patterns between ideas
- Any signature moves or distinctive habits

### Phase 3: Build the Negative Constraints

This step is mandatory and is the most important part of the style guide.

**The problem you must solve:** When you write "in my style," you will inject your own AI default patterns into my voice unless explicitly prevented. My writing samples may be clean and authentic, but your output will be contaminated with AI tells I never used. The negative constraints prevent you from polluting my voice.

**Default ban list.** Apply all of the following unless my writing samples show I actually use these patterns. If you find any of these patterns in my samples, flag them and ask me whether to keep or ban them.

**Structural AI Tells:**
- **Do not use** em dashes as default separator (use parentheses, commas, or restructure)
- **Do not use** triple lists or groups of three as a default (vary: 2, 4, 5 items)
- **Do not use** formulaic negation contrasts ("It's not just X, it's Y"; "Rather than X, we see Y"; "not only X, but also Y")
- **Do not use** "moreover," "furthermore," "additionally," "in addition" as default transitions

**Importance Puffing:**
- **Do not use** "pivotal moment," "significant shift," "broader movement," "notable example," "key aspect," "crucial element"
- **Do not use** "serves as a testament to," "underscores the importance of," "cannot be overstated"
- **Do not use** sentence-initial "Importantly," "Notably," "Crucially," "Significantly"

**Trailing Participle Clauses:**
- **Do not use** "reflecting the importance of," "highlighting the need for"
- **Do not use** "demonstrating the value of," "showcasing the potential of"
- **Do not use** "emphasizing the significance of," "illustrating the impact of"
- **Do not use** "paving the way for," "speaking to the need for"

**Padding & Hedging:**
- **Do not use** "It is worth noting that," "It is important to recognize," "It is clear that"
- **Do not use** "One might argue," "It could be suggested that"
- **Do not use** "To a certain extent," "In many ways," "This raises important questions about"

**Generic Superlatives:**
- **Do not use** "groundbreaking," "transformative," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary"
- **Do not use** "game-changing," "paradigm-shifting," "unprecedented"

**Marketing Language:**
- **Do not use** "robust," "dynamic," "vibrant," "seamless," "innovative," "synergistic," "holistic"
- **Do not use** "leverage" (say "use"), "utilize" (say "use")
- **Do not use** "ecosystem," "landscape" (metaphorical), "realm," "tapestry"

**AI Filler Phrases:**
- **Do not use** "At its core," "At the heart of," "In an era of," "In today's [adjective] landscape"
- **Do not use** "delve into," "shed light on," "navigate" (metaphorical), "foster" (generic)
- **Do not use** "nuanced understanding," "multifaceted," "interplay between"

After applying the default ban list and checking it against my samples, ask me if there are field-specific or personal patterns I want to add or remove.

### Phase 4: Build Deliverables

Create these five items:

**1. Style Analysis**
Detailed breakdown of my writing patterns organized by structure, sentences, tone, vocabulary, evidence use, and distinctive habits. Include specific examples quoted from my samples.

**2. Prompt Template**
A self-contained prompt I can paste into any new AI conversation to get writing in my style. It should include positive rules (what to do), negative constraints (what not to do), and end with: "JUST APPLY NATURALLY. Do not announce you are following a style guide. Do not add meta-commentary."

**3. User Style Config (for Claude.ai)**
A condensed version (under 500 words) formatted for pasting into Claude's profile settings (Settings > Profile > Writing Style). Include a note that users on other platforms can upload the full Prompt Template file instead.

**4. Test Sample**
A 500-750 word piece on a topic relevant to my field, written using my style guide. After writing it, self-audit: identify any place where you may have injected AI patterns despite the constraints. Be honest. Flag them.

**5. Usage Guide**
Brief instructions on how to use each deliverable, how to iterate and refine, and how to adapt the style for different audiences or contexts.

### Phase 5: Test and Iterate

After delivering the test sample:

1. Show me the test sample first, before the other deliverables.
2. Point out any AI contamination you caught in your self-audit.
3. Ask me: "Does this sound like you? What feels off?"
4. Revise based on my feedback.
5. Repeat until I confirm the test sample matches my authentic voice.
6. Only then deliver the final package.

## Rules for You

- Be specific. Pull examples from my actual writing. Do not create generic rules that could apply to anyone.
- If my samples seem inconsistent, ask me about it. Do not guess.
- Challenge my style if you see weaknesses, but frame it as observation, not correction.
- The negative constraints are not optional. They are the most important part.
- Do not pad your analysis with filler. Be direct.
- Do not announce that you are following these instructions.
